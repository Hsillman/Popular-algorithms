This repo contains some well known algorithms but also some good variations of their usage.

## Merge Sort
Download the mergeSort.py file, change the array you want to sort and run it with `python mergeSort.py`. 
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn) and the space complexity is O(n). Further explanation inside the mergeSort.py file.

### Depth-First-Traversal
In this folder there is a file that contains the iterative and recursive versions of Depth First Traversals. Basically, there are 3 types of Depth First Traversals: <b>Pre-order</b>, <b>Post-order</b> and <b>In-order</b>. Download the file inside the TreeTraversals folder and run it with `python Depth-First-Traversal-Tree.py`. You can modify the Tree structure to your desire. The code will print all of the mentioned traversals.

### Breadth-First-Traversal
In the Tree Traversals folder there is a implementation of Breadth-First-Traversal. Download the file inside the TreeTraversals folder and run it with `python Breadth-First-Traversal-Tree.py`. You can modify the Tree structure to your desire.
