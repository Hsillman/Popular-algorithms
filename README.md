This repo contains some well known algorithms but also some good variations of their usage.

## Merge Sort
Download the mergeSort.py file, change the array you want to sort and run it with `python mergeSort.py`. 
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn) and the space complexity is O(n). Further explanation inside the mergeSort.py file.
